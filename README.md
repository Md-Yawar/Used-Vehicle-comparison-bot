# Used-Vehicle-comparison-bot
## CLointFusion Hackathon 9.0
Used vehicle comparison bot was assigned to me by [ClointFusion](https://clointfusion.com/company/) in its [Hackathon 9.0](https://sites.google.com/view/clointfusion-hackathon). [Fharook Shaik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fharook-shaik/) was assigned my mentor. <br /><br />
It is a bot using clointfusion which takes user input as city name and car name/model and retrieves the car information from the cars24 and MahindraFirstChoice website.The user have to give the information (the city names and the car model) in seperate json files stored in the Config_files folder. User also have to store his Outlook credentials and the email id to which he want to send the email. The information is stored in excel sheets, the sheets are then compressed in a zip file and it is then sent as an email to the user. The excel sheets will have the city name, the car name/model and the current date as the name. <br /><br />
It was a very good learning experience. kudos to [ClointFusion](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clointfusion-india-889a961b8/?originalSubdomain=in) team for organizing such a successful event.<br /><br />
